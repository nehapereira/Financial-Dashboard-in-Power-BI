## Problem Statement

In modern corporate finance, the accurate tracking and analysis of financial health are critical yet challenging. Financial managers face the intricate task of maintaining up-to-date records across various reports such as income statements, balance sheets, cash flows, and aged trial balances. Specifically, the management of aged trial balances, which are crucial for effective accounts receivable management and liquidity assessment, often becomes cumbersome with traditional tools. These tools frequently fail to deliver real-time, consolidated views of financial data, leading to delays in financial decision-making and inefficiencies in managing credit and cash flows. There is an essential need for an integrated financial dashboard that not only simplifies the visualization of complex financial data but also enables quick, informed decisions based on comprehensive, real-time financial insights.
